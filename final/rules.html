      - Because there are two big magnets on each side of the cave, a player can <br />
       only place a brick on an empty cell<br />
      of the cave provided that the brick is stacked directly on the left or right wall,<br />

    <p>As soon as one player is able to align 5 consecutive bricks in a row, in a column or<br />
       in a diagonal, then this
      player wins the game.<br />

      - If no player is able to achieve a winning configuration and the board is full,<br />
       then the game stops and there is a tie.</p>
